            <div class="abstractfront">
                More and more we see technology, both hardware and software, intersect with fundamental issues like privacy, democracy and human rights. The opaqueness of tech makes it a handy instrument of oppression and manipulation.
            </div>
            <div class="abstractfront">
                How could a government use tech to rig an election and why would they? How can we re-engineer the electoral process to protect it's integrity, and how can we communicate those changes to the population? What makes elections so hard to protect?

                During the past years we’ve been developing the Botani.st platform for urban farming. Since we don’t want our customers to end up with a plastic brick when we go bust one design philosophy has been to open as much as possible from protocols to hardware to software. And since we rely on so much open source in the project itself it’s not more than fair.
            </div>
            <div class="abstractfront">
                This talk will cover how we’ve designed the platform and some of the choices needed to balance openess, price and usability.

                Claes has been hacking and talking open source the past 20 years and co-founded and runs a few user groups such as FOSS-Sthlm and Stockholm PostgreSQL User Group. He spends his day hacking on various things over at Trustly but not-so-secretly loves embedded and hardware thus starting the Botani.st project in 2014-ish to solve the mystery of dying plants.
