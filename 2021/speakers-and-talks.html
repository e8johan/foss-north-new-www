                In the 21st century, software can be considered vital public infrastructure. From municipal parking services to public school administration software has become fundamental to how public organizations function.

                But software that runs our society today is often hidden in proprietary code bases, producing data not owned by the public, and licensed at ever-increasing cost from outside companies.

                Most public organizations recognize the need for a change, but are not always empowered to take leadership through it. The Foundation for Public Code has developed a concept called codebase stewardship. With this stewardship public organizations that have decided to collaborate when developing code get the help they need. This talk explains how it works.

                D-Bus is a popular IPC mechanism used by various services on most desktop and many embedded Linux systems in the wild. It is heavily used by even the most essential services, such as systemd. Unfortunately, for a long time, there was only one Rust D-Bus crate and most users were not happy about it for various reasons, most notably that it depends on a notoriously bad C library, libdbus. zbus, was created out of this demand for a pure Rust API that makes D-Bus easy and simple. With both elegance and efficiency as the top goals, the development of of zbus has been a much greater challenge than original anticipated but slowly they were all overcome.

            <div class="abstract">
                Last year, zbus had its 1.0 release and it was a major success story, with most projects porting their code to it and very happy with the results.

As a bonus, our newly added asynchronous API, along with its benefits over the synchronous one, will also be presented.

                Teams should be able to work independently. In an ideal world, a team has control over all components needed to ship value to their customers. Often though that is far from true. In more than the past two decades Open Source projects have shown how much value can be generated by pooling resources and collaborating globally across organisations to solve challenges together.

It looks into highly visible things, like creating widgets and parts of the user interface and compares it to working with modern JavaScript web frameworks like Angular and React. Then we take a step further and add non-trivial "business logic", interacting with data locally, working with the rest of Gnome and the OS.

                As the adoption of open source software grows, organizations that have traditionally relied upon proprietary software are taking their first steps to architect open source business strategies. For open source software vendors, acting as partner and community co-creator with these organizations is a critical aspect of opening new market opportunities, advancing innovation, and increasing overall value for their customers. But what does community engagement actually mean when considered through the lens of an industry vertical rather than a particular software project?

                When Stockholm introduced their new school platform, the reception was not good. A very expensive project turned out to be unusual for many users. As a reaction, a group of parents took things into their own hands by building the open school platform - "Ã–ppna skolplattformen" - an alternative front-end to the school platform, providing a user centric experience.

It covers the latest technologies and innovations from data science and artificial intelligence to DevOps tooling and Blockchain. In this session, you will learn the latest on the growing open-source ecosystem across multiple platform architectures. Specifically, we are going to focus on open-source software for the s390x process architecture platform. Traditionally known as mainframes, this platform hosts the most crucial business functions in all industries. For decades, they have continued to improve their technology in high-speed transaction processing, capacity for large volumes of transactions, best-in-class compression, cryptography, containerization, and cloud-native applications. What a better way to grow your open-source project than making it available for multiple platforms including x86, ARM64, and s390x.

                RISC-V is seeing more interest than ever as a free alternative to other instruction set architectures. One of its more unique features is its modularity, allowing it to potentially be used anywhere from small, embedded systems to warehouse computing.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                The Oberon system is a free operating system that is still maintained by one of its creators, Niklaus Wirth, who is most well-known as the designer of Pascal. The operating system is very small, occupying less than 200kB when compiled, while being both simple and fast. Furthermore, in its most recent edition, Oberon is accompanied by a very simple RISC instruction set architecture designed specifically for it. This is to help its foremost goal, that a single person can understand every part of the system from the chip to firmware and software.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                This paper evaluates the RISC-V ISA by describing the process of porting the Oberon system and the Oberon compiler to it, and seeing whether RISC-V truly is simple enough that the Oberon system remains small and fast, despite using an ISA that was not specifically designed for it. It finds that RISC-V introduces some minor complications to the system, along with making compiled binaries slightly larger. However, its detriment is negligible to the system as a whole, both in terms of size and performance.
