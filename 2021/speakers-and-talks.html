                Teams should be able to work independently. In an ideal world, a team has control over all components needed to ship value to their customers. Often though that is far from true. In more than the past two decades Open Source projects have shown how much value can be generated by pooling resources and collaborating globally across organisations to solve challenges together.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                In this talk we will see how using Open Source collaboration best practices in your organisation can help deal with team interdependencies. We will see how solving common challenges together can increase speed and innovation. Finally we will explore how what we've learnt translates to your relationship of Open Source projects as a user.

                In this talk we're going to show those techniques with an example of writing a network Linux driver from scratch. We will look into the documentation, source code of similar drivers, show what the driver should be doing to be functional.. and more. The audience will be encouraged to use the same methodology for any other unfamiliar code base.
