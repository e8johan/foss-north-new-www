                VR took off for the consumer with the release of Oculus consumer hardware. But the hardware lacked open source drivers and Linux support in general. The consumer VR space has now grown from a kickstarter campaign into a large industry. But this growth has its down sides, multiple companies have their own APIs competing. Luckily these companies have agreed to work on a single API under the Khronos umbrella. Now that OpenXR has been released and and the Monado project has been getting more stable it is now possible to do good VR on a completely open stack.

                The KDE Free Qt Foundation is a tool like a reverse Fiduciary License Agreement: it ensures that a Free Software project that is owned, controlled and enabled by a commercial entity cannot be turned into proprietary software. It was created in the early days of the KDE project to ensure that the Qt toolkit always remains Free Software.

                This talk discusses the reasoning behind the tool and the ways in which it safeguards software Freedom while enabling commerical and even proprietary development. We believe that the structure of a "last resort" foundation combined with a strong contract is a good alternative to weird "Open Source" licenses with field-of-use restrictions. The KDE Free Qt foundation has survived four changes of ownership of the toolkit that it safeguards.

                Any piece of an open source software is distributed under the terms of an open source license. A license is a binding contract and you must comply with the terms of any and all relevant licenses used in your product. Some licenses are only 2-3 paragraphs of clear-cut text, others are 2-3 pages of legalese jungle. To understand which terms apply to your project, you have to read and interpret the licenses yourself… or call the lawyer. The good news is that while all the different agreements are unique, there are several key concepts. Regardless of how much experience with foss licenses you have or how savvy you are at reading legal texts, you can easily navigate provisions of any license using these key concepts that would be presented during the talk.

                Developing Free Software is fun, but dealing with the licensing and copyright information is not. The REUSE project changes that: with three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines.

                If you want to grant users the freedom to use, study, share, and improve your software, you have to grant those freedoms in the license of the software. To encourage people to develop Free Software, the FSFE helps developers to understand and apply Free Software licensing. REUSE contributes to this goal. Any project following the initiative's recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable to both: humans and machines. This way, we want to ensure that individuals, organisations and companies who are re-using code are aware of the license terms chosen by the original author.

                Large amounts of data are being collected about IoT systems---a tendency known as big data. Much of the collected data is private: it contains details about individuals and their behaviour. Privacy concerns about individuals restrict the way that such a huge amount of information can be used and released. In this light, information collected by IoT devices must be handled in a way that users' privacy gets preserve and thus comply with ethical, legal, or business reasons.

                It is often believed that data can be just anatomized somehow in order to preserve the privacy of individuals. Simple removing some identifiers or data fields from a dataset is not enough. There are notorious cases that illustrate that traditional disclosure techniques lack rigorous analysis and guarantees, where re-identification attacks are possible.

                Differential privacy, a concept originated in academia, is currently the only mechanism that rigorously captures the trade-offs of adding noise to a query to protect the privacy of individuals while enabling to extract useful insights from it. However, adding noise might reduce how meaningful queries' results are in favour of privacy---e.g., in the extreme case, a completely random answer preserves privacy but is rather useless.

                Many moons ago, Viktor had a problem. Due to a strange series of events, he was put in charge of building a digital signage software in just two weeks. As an Open Source enthusiast, he naturally built this by gluing together various Open Source components and running on small Asus Linux boxes. It wasn’t pretty, but it did in fact work. This turned out to be the precursor to Screenly OSE, which is now the most popular digital signage project on GitHub and is powering 10k+ of Raspberry Pis around the globe.

                While still in college Viktor co-founded the software company WireLoad, Inc which grew into a thriving business with multiple products. WireLoad's latest product, Screenly, has grewn to become the most popular open source solution on Github, powering thousands of screens around the world, all powered by Raspberry Pis.

                Developing a system comprised of both software and hardware components comes with its extra set of challenges. Hardware gets delayed, the team that works closer to the electronics has to sync with the ones hacking on the cloud or the app, arguments erupt over unilateral assumptions about how things should be, etc. On the other hand, it is particularly rewarding seeing your efforts materialized in a physical form and the customers naturally interacting with your precious device.

                Software Engineering students at the University of Gothenburg, as part of their compulsory curriculum, are offered a course on systems development. They work in teams and are given a small robot development platform with the task to create a multitier product around it. They are inexperienced, with different availability, priorities and expectations, but full of creativity.

                How do we teach them to avoid the common pitfalls we witness in the industry? How do we facilitate collaboration between individuals engaged in separate parts of the system? How do we inspire them to establish a repeatable, well-defined development process? How do we convince them to build a robust and valuable system with the discipline of an engineer along with the freedom of an artist?

                In this talk, we are going to illustrate how we address these issues through the adoption of best practices common in open source projects and organizations. Combined with freely available tools, we enable and inspire the students to follow industrial standards and eventually produce better engineers for the future.

                JobTech Dev is an initiative from the Swedish Public Employment Service where the goal is to create a common platform of open source software, data, and standards for private actors and citizens to build on. Envisioned outcomes include a higher variety of services and better matching for employers and job-seekers, as well as a lower barrier to entry for new job-matching service provides.
