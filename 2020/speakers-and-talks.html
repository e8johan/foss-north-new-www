                In this talk will cover Monado and Khronos' OpenXR standard, and give an overview about the current state of open source VR and what lies ahead. Also go into some details of how tracking is done inside of Monado and show of the current state.

                VR took off for the consumer with the release of Oculus consumer hardware. But the hardware lacked open source drivers and Linux support in general. The consumer VR space has now grown from a kickstarter campaign into a large industry. But this growth has its down sides, multiple companies have their own APIs competing. Luckily these companies have agreed to work on a single API under the Khronos umbrella. Now that OpenXR has been released and and the Monado project has been getting more stable it is now possible to do good VR on a completely open stack.

                Developing a system comprised of both software and hardware components comes with its extra set of challenges. Hardware gets delayed, the team that works closer to the electronics has to sync with the ones hacking on the cloud or the app, arguments erupt over unilateral assumptions about how things should be, etc. On the other hand, it is particularly rewarding seeing your efforts materialized in a physical form and the customers naturally interacting with your precious device.

                Software Engineering students at the University of Gothenburg, as part of their compulsory curriculum, are offered a course on systems development. They work in teams and are given a small robot development platform with the task to create a multitier product around it. They are inexperienced, with different availability, priorities and expectations, but full of creativity.

            <div class="abstract">
                How do we teach them to avoid the common pitfalls we witness in the industry? How do we facilitate collaboration between individuals engaged in separate parts of the system? How do we inspire them to establish a repeatable, well-defined development process? How do we convince them to build a robust and valuable system with the discipline of an engineer along with the freedom of an artist?

            <div class="abstract">
                In this talk, we are going to illustrate how we address these issues through the adoption of best practices common in open source projects and organizations. Combined with freely available tools, we enable and inspire the students to follow industrial standards and eventually produce better engineers for the future.
