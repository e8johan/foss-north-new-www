                When developers use and contribute to open source projects, effective documentation can make all the difference between a positive experience or a negative experience. Providing effective documentation can build healthy and inclusive communities, thereby increasing the usability and retention rate of your product/ project, but most often, open source creators produce ineffective documentation.

                VR took off for the consumer with the release of Oculus consumer hardware. But the hardware lacked open source drivers and Linux support in general. The consumer VR space has now grown from a kickstarter campaign into a large industry. But this growth has its down sides, multiple companies have their own APIs competing. Luckily these companies have agreed to work on a single API under the Khronos umbrella. Now that OpenXR has been released and and the Monado project has been getting more stable it is now possible to do good VR on a completely open stack.

                The conventional approach to building container images starts by importing a base image of a Linux distribution. Then a Dockerfile is used to install the software stack. Part of it might be installed into the image through the distribution's package, while the other part might be built from source. The integration of such an image requires multiple steps. The complexity of distribution packages is not that well suited for the simplicity of container images. Maintaining software builds from source through Dockerfile is also unpractical. This complexity makes it hard to maintain a container image. Freedesktop SDK is a base runtime for Linux desktop applications using Flatpak. We have used BuildStream as an integration tool to build the image without requiring depending on a distribution. The approach used also translates easily to layered Open Container Initiative (OCI) images through a BuildStream plugin. This talk will show how (multiple) OCI images can be fully built in one pass from a BuildStream specification.

                The KDE Free Qt Foundation is a tool like a reverse Fiduciary License Agreement: it ensures that a Free Software project that is owned, controlled and enabled by a commercial entity cannot be turned into proprietary software. It was created in the early days of the KDE project to ensure that the Qt toolkit always remains Free Software.

                This talk discusses the reasoning behind the tool and the ways in which it safeguards software Freedom while enabling commerical and even proprietary development. We believe that the structure of a "last resort" foundation combined with a strong contract is a good alternative to weird "Open Source" licenses with field-of-use restrictions. The KDE Free Qt foundation has survived four changes of ownership of the toolkit that it safeguards.

This talk will describe how we came to replace the proprietary tools with open source tools, and how this have had a very positive impact on our work with improving the quality of our streaming services.

                Ceph is a free software cluster storage solution that enables near-infinite scaling on commodity hardware, and Rook is a project that brings Ceph to Kubernetes as a storage provider, as well as other open source storage solutions. In this presentation I will do my best to introduce these technologies, talk a bit about what makes them unique and perhaps provide some motivation for when and why they may be relevant to you.

                Today, every company is a software company. Even companies with a core business that is not about developing software products are building software to help run their businesses. More and more, development organizations are using open source software as part of their applications in order to support their agility and efficiency goals. While the benefits of using open source software are apparent, organizations need to manage the vulnerabilities and risks associated with that use. In this session you will learn about the business impact of security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues presented to organizations that use open source software. You will also learn how Software Composition Analysis tools, such as WhiteSource Software, can help to automate and simplify the process of managing vulnerability and compliance issues throughout the Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC). The session will include a hands-on workshop using WhiteSource Software to scan code for open source libraries, build an inventory of these libraries, and highlight identified security vulnerabilities, the licenses associated with these libraries, and the identified risk they present.

                In the last few years we saw a lot of discussion in the open source and free software startup space around licenses. Several companies stepped forward and claimed that it’s not possible to build a working company on top of a free software product. Some changed the license of their product to proprietary license like the Commons Clause or the Business Source License. They claim that this is needed to ‘save’ free software. This talk describes why this is fundamentally wrong. It’s possible to build a working startup and company on top of a free software product. This talk discusses how companies like Red Hat, SUSE and Nextcloud manages to have a 100% free software product including a big contributor community but is still able to pay developers and grow.

                Any piece of an open source software is distributed under the terms of an open source license. A license is a binding contract and you must comply with the terms of any and all relevant licenses used in your product. Some licenses are only 2-3 paragraphs of clear-cut text, others are 2-3 pages of legalese jungle. To understand which terms apply to your project, you have to read and interpret the licenses yourself… or call the lawyer. The good news is that while all the different agreements are unique, there are several key concepts. Regardless of how much experience with foss licenses you have or how savvy you are at reading legal texts, you can easily navigate provisions of any license using these key concepts that would be presented during the talk.

                Developing Free Software is fun, but dealing with the licensing and copyright information is not. The REUSE project changes that: with three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines.

            <div class="abstract">
                If you want to grant users the freedom to use, study, share, and improve your software, you have to grant those freedoms in the license of the software. To encourage people to develop Free Software, the FSFE helps developers to understand and apply Free Software licensing. REUSE contributes to this goal. Any project following the initiative's recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable to both: humans and machines. This way, we want to ensure that individuals, organisations and companies who are re-using code are aware of the license terms chosen by the original author.

In this light, information collected by IoT devices must be handled in a way that users' privacy gets preserve and thus comply with ethical, legal, or business reasons.

                It is often believed that data can be just anatomized somehow in order to preserve the privacy of individuals. Simple removing some identifiers or data fields from a dataset is not enough. There are notorious cases that illustrate that traditional disclosure techniques lack rigorous analysis and guarantees, where re-identification attacks are possible.

                Differential privacy, a concept originated in academia, is currently the only mechanism that rigorously captures the trade-offs of adding noise to a query to protect the privacy of individuals while enabling to extract useful insights from it. However, adding noise might reduce how meaningful queries' results are in favour of privacy---e.g., in the extreme case, a completely random answer preserves privacy but is rather useless.

                In this talk, we will present DPella, a programming language being developed at Chalmers University, which enables developers to write differentially private queries, while enabling to study how meaningful the result of the queries are. We will show how to securely implement traditional statistical analyses with DPella (e.g., histograms, cumulative distributed functions, etc.), thus allowing to mine useful information for sensible datasets gathered by our IoT devices.

                I am a PhD student in the Information Security division at Chalmers. I'm interested in exploring the usage of embedded domain-specific languages (EDSLs) in Haskell to provide privacy or security guarantees for different applications. For the past year, I've been working on creating a framework for privacy-preserving queries---under differential privacy---that allows programmers to reason about the accuracy of the queries statically.

We will start with what happens when a device is powered on , tell a bit about some x86 and ARM bootloaders, and simplify (and unify) the procedures so that we concentrate on how the Linux Kernel is loaded, and what it needs in order to do something that is "useful" for most users/developers - such as loading the first userspace program, which may or may not load the next one, which may or may not...

Hardware gets delayed, the team that works closer to the electronics has to sync with the ones hacking on the cloud or the app, arguments erupt over unilateral assumptions about how things should be, etc. On the other hand, it is particularly rewarding seeing your efforts materialized in a physical form and the customers naturally interacting with your precious device.

                As you contemplate how to put together the system software for your next Embedded Linux project you will probably be wondering which is the best path to take? Use a Linux distro such as Debian, (or another of your choosing), or create a custom operating system using Yocto Project (or Open Embedded or Buildroot). At first sight, Debian looks easy, especially if you are using a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBone or another board with a pre-installed Debian-derived system. So, why go to all the trouble of replacing it with Yocto?

                In this talk I will show you the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, using real-world use cases as examples. Spoiler alert: my conclusion is that … it all depends what you want to do. Debian is great for fast implementation and proof-of-concept, but for long term maintainability and control of the platform, you need Yocto. Now you need to come along to see why I believe this to be so.

                JobTech Dev is an initiative from the Swedish Public Employment Service where the goal is to create a common platform of open source software, data, and standards for private actors and citizens to build on. Envisioned outcomes include a higher variety of services and better matching for employers and job-seekers, as well as a lower barrier to entry for new job-matching service provides.

            <div class="abstract">
                We will present an overview of the platform and share a public-sector organization's rationale for sharing software as open source. Attendees will further get insights into the potential value and ways of extending collaboration and co-creation beyond open source software to also include related open data and standards.

            <div class="abstract">
                We will also present opportunities as well as challenges that the Employment Service has experienced while adopting a platform approach, as well as the open source way of working required when growing and working with a community. Lessons learned will be contrasted to those commonly experienced among companies that's undergone similar journeys.
