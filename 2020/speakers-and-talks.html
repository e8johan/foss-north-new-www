            <div class="abstract">
                This talks builds up on the great talk from the famous Daniel Stenberg titled "Writing safe and secure code" last year at foss-north. In their talk, they shared their story and wisdom on what steps to take and which tools to use to ensure that the code you write in unsafe languages, like C and C++ can be made to be very safe and secure. While all the information presented in that talk was completely accurate and all the advice given, was indeed very sound, I felt it fell short of recognising some of the modern technologies that can make the process much easier and a reliable.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                One such major technology, is Rust programming language. Rust was designed from ground up to be both efficient and safe. Its focus on efficiency, means that it gives you a similar performance (and even better in certain cases) to C and C++, while simultaneous, its focus also on safety means that most common types of memory issues of C and C++ just can not happen with Rust code.

            <div class="abstract">
                In this talk, I will present how exactly Rust allows you to do that through code samples. I will also demonstrate how Rust helps to catch runtime issues, that the compiler can not possibly catch, early on by enabling you to write tests more easily.

                When developers use and contribute to open source projects, effective documentation can make all the difference between a positive experience or a negative experience. Providing effective documentation can build healthy and inclusive communities, thereby increasing the usability and retention rate of your product/ project, but most often, open source creators produce ineffective documentation.

                VR took off for the consumer with the release of Oculus consumer hardware. But the hardware lacked open source drivers and Linux support in general. The consumer VR space has now grown from a kickstarter campaign into a large industry. But this growth has its down sides, multiple companies have their own APIs competing. Luckily these companies have agreed to work on a single API under the Khronos umbrella. Now that OpenXR has been released and and the Monado project has been getting more stable it is now possible to do good VR on a completely open stack.

            <div class="abstract">
                The conventional approach to building container images starts by importing a base image of a Linux distribution. Then a Dockerfile is used to install the software stack. Part of it might be installed into the image through the distribution's package, while the other part might be built from source. The integration of such an image requires multiple steps. The complexity of distribution packages is not that well suited for the simplicity of container images. Maintaining software builds from source through Dockerfile is also unpractical. This complexity makes it hard to maintain a container image. Freedesktop SDK is a base runtime for Linux desktop applications using Flatpak. We have used BuildStream as an integration tool to build the image without requiring depending on a distribution. The approach used also translates easily to layered Open Container Initiative (OCI) images through a BuildStream plugin. This talk will show how (multiple) OCI images can be fully built in one pass from a BuildStream specification.

                Any piece of an open source software is distributed under the terms of an open source license. A license is a binding contract and you must comply with the terms of any and all relevant licenses used in your product. Some licenses are only 2-3 paragraphs of clear-cut text, others are 2-3 pages of legalese jungle. To understand which terms apply to your project, you have to read and interpret the licenses yourself… or call the lawyer. The good news is that while all the different agreements are unique, there are several key concepts. Regardless of how much experience with foss licenses you have or how savvy you are at reading legal texts, you can easily navigate provisions of any license using these key concepts that would be presented during the talk.

                Developing Free Software is fun, but dealing with the licensing and copyright information is not. The REUSE project changes that: with three simple steps, it makes adding and reading licensing and copyright information easy for both humans and machines.
            </div>
            
            <div class="abstract">
                If you want to grant users the freedom to use, study, share, and improve your software, you have to grant those freedoms in the license of the software. To encourage people to develop Free Software, the FSFE helps developers to understand and apply Free Software licensing. REUSE contributes to this goal. Any project following the initiative's recommendations makes copyright and licensing information readable to both: humans and machines. This way, we want to ensure that individuals, organisations and companies who are re-using code are aware of the license terms chosen by the original author.

                Large amounts of data are being collected about IoT systems---a tendency known as big data. Much of the collected data is private: it contains details about individuals and their behaviour. Privacy concerns about individuals restrict the way that such a huge amount of information can be used and released. In this light, information collected by IoT devices must be handled in a way that users' privacy gets preserve and thus comply with ethical, legal, or business reasons.

                It is often believed that data can be just anatomized somehow in order to preserve the privacy of individuals. Simple removing some identifiers or data fields from a dataset is not enough. There are notorious cases that illustrate that traditional disclosure techniques lack rigorous analysis and guarantees, where re-identification attacks are possible.

                Differential privacy, a concept originated in academia, is currently the only mechanism that rigorously captures the trade-offs of adding noise to a query to protect the privacy of individuals while enabling to extract useful insights from it. However, adding noise might reduce how meaningful queries' results are in favour of privacy---e.g., in the extreme case, a completely random answer preserves privacy but is rather useless.

                Many moons ago, Viktor had a problem. Due to a strange series of events, he was put in charge of building a digital signage software in just two weeks. As an Open Source enthusiast, he naturally built this by gluing together various Open Source components and running on small Asus Linux boxes. It wasn’t pretty, but it did in fact work. This turned out to be the precursor to Screenly OSE, which is now the most popular digital signage project on GitHub and is powering 10k+ of Raspberry Pis around the globe.

                Developing a system comprised of both software and hardware components comes with its extra set of challenges. Hardware gets delayed, the team that works closer to the electronics has to sync with the ones hacking on the cloud or the app, arguments erupt over unilateral assumptions about how things should be, etc. On the other hand, it is particularly rewarding seeing your efforts materialized in a physical form and the customers naturally interacting with your precious device.

                Software Engineering students at the University of Gothenburg, as part of their compulsory curriculum, are offered a course on systems development. They work in teams and are given a small robot development platform with the task to create a multitier product around it. They are inexperienced, with different availability, priorities and expectations, but full of creativity.

                How do we teach them to avoid the common pitfalls we witness in the industry? How do we facilitate collaboration between individuals engaged in separate parts of the system? How do we inspire them to establish a repeatable, well-defined development process? How do we convince them to build a robust and valuable system with the discipline of an engineer along with the freedom of an artist?

                We are at a stage on which most distributions can just use cryptsetup as a normal part of their boot process to decrypt an encrypted partition. But as you drift away from the usual "user enters password to decrypt single partition model", you keep finding more and more hurdles. In this talk I will talk about my experiences integrating full disk hardware encryption (with OPAL) without user interaction as a way to secure unattended systems against data theft. After this talk you will gain an understanding on what is OPAL and how it interacts with the usual boot process of Linux systems.

                Francisco has always had the curiosity inherent to hackers to take apart things to see how they worked and even fix them. He even learnt how to use MS-DOS with 7 years so he could play Commander Queen on his father’s computer. But, although things looked as if he was just going to be a computer programmer, after spending a summer reading Bruce Schneier’s applied cryptography and taking part, after lots of persuasion by the organizers, on a CTF competition where he wrote his own tools; things started escalating quickly. Since then Francisco has done things like participating in some CTFs, becoming a Gentoo Hardened developer, writing an Arduino bootloader able to cryptographically verify updates, contributed cryptographic code to the Haskell community, written a fast implementation of the TTH algorithm and championed the introduction of new standards in the ADC protocol. Having seen the world from different angles in his prior positions, currently, Francisco is working as a PhD. student at Chalmers with the Resilient IOT project whilst taking small consultant jobs on the side.

                As you contemplate how to put together the system software for your next Embedded Linux project you will probably be wondering which is the best path to take? Use a Linux distro such as Debian, (or another of your choosing), or create a custom operating system using Yocto Project (or Open Embedded or Buildroot). At first sight, Debian looks easy, especially if you are using a Raspberry Pi, a BeagleBone or another board with a pre-installed Debian-derived system. So, why go to all the trouble of replacing it with Yocto?

            <div class="abstract">
                In this talk I will show you the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, using real-world use cases as examples. Spoiler alert: my conclusion is that … it all depends what you want to do. Debian is great for fast implementation and proof-of-concept, but for long term maintainability and control of the platform, you need Yocto. Now you need to come along to see why I believe this to be so.
