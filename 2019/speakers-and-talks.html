                Now, as SVT is looking for a broader collaboration with other public broadcasters, we have recently adopted a new Open Source policy that encourages developers to be more active in the Open Source community.

                Long gone are the days of massive books with never-ending stories about your software. Today's users are smarter and less patient, which means that we no longer need to document *all the things*, as long as what we do document is clear, concise, helpful, and accessible. And that's where the real work starts.

                Documentation requires some attitude adjustment, since prose doesn't neatly compile into binaries as code does. But Don't Panic(tm)! No matter what your role is, you can apply a few key principles from the technical writing world to make your project more docs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly.

                The standards community develops specifications. The FOSS community implements standards. The FOSS community also develops industry standards. How does this the interaction function? And is it working well? How do policy makers interact with the FOSS community to set safety standards and other requirements? What is the relationship between standards-essential patents and FOSS? What comes first, specification or implementation? Where does innovation happen, and what is the platform to develop consensus on technical standards in a market segment? Based on research work at TU Berlin and for the Joint Research Center of the European Commission and the work of the Open Invention Network to protect key FOSS projects from patent litigation, the presentation will discuss the current state of the debate at the European and international level, and provide an outlook on how the roles and functions of standards-development organisations and the wider FOSS community are converging.

                Have you attended an orchestral performance and wondered what it is exactly that conductors do besides waving their arms in the air? Most of the value that the conductor (community manager) brings to the orchestra (community) is carried out before the performance (behind the scenes). In this session, I will share my experiences in orchestras and open source communities big and small across different countries. How do you take care of the different types of contributors/players and bring out their best? What happens when they have differences in opinion on how to collaborate? How do you make the community welcoming and inclusive especially for people with different backgrounds and who may not speak your (programming) language? Join me on a musical journey through some of the common (and perhaps not so common) dissonances of community orchestration and their possible resolutions!

                One of my favorite papers in computer science is the original LISP paper by John McCarthy. Written in 1959, it describes something mind-bending: The interpreter for a language in the language that it interprets. If you understand this paper, you understand how computation works.
            </div><div class="abstract">
                A few years ago, I decided to implement the interpreter described in the paper, and this project turned out to be surprisingly popular. In this presentation, I'll show how to implement the original LISP interpreter in C, and together we will marvel at its elegance.

                As long as Linux isn't pre-installed on your hardware, you need to install it yourself. The big five Linux distro's have their own tools, but for the hundreds of boutique distro's with specialised purposes, those tools are not (necessarily) suitable. Calamares is a Linux System Installer that is built to be customisable and tailorable for boutique distro's. It encourages shared development and cooperation for derivatives, spins, mixes and niche players.

                The Red Hat portfolio includes about 50 different products. There was a need for a design system as different patterns were build over and over again which led to inconsistency. The UXD goal is to bring consistent user experience to the entire Red Hat portfolio. This talk explains why it is important to have a unified look and feel. Patternfly is an open-source design system that helps our designers and engineers build user friendly products. As the frontend technologies are constantly evolving, this design system has to evolve with them. We would like to talk about the history and evolution of PatternFly - how it was created and how it tries to handle the continuous evolution of the frontend landscape. Perspectives from both design and engineering will be included.

                Did you ever miss that corner case bug? Maybe it was a negative integer, strange timezone conversion behaviour, off by one error or something entirely else. These subtle bugs are often hard to catch and are easily missed in test cases. You like me have probably ran into plenty of code utilising only happy path testing, only to later discover subtle bugs which are easily fixed once pointed out.

                This is where property based testing comes into the picture. In this talk I will focus on a wonderful Python library called Hypothesis but the concepts apply to other languages as well. Hypethesis is based on the same concept as the famous QuickCheck library for Haskell, which in turn have been ported a large number of languages. Hypothesis uses a wide range of input to find edge cases that you could otherwise easily miss, once it finds these cases it narrows down the input to the minimal breaking example to provide failures which are easier to understand.

                User namespaces are at the heart of many interesting technologies that allow isolation and sandboxing of applications, for example running containers without root privileges and sandboxes for web browser plug-ins. In this tutorial, we'll look in detail at user namespaces, building up a basic understanding of what a user namespace is and going on to questions such as: what does being &ldquo;superuser inside a user namespace&rdquo; allow you do (and what does it not allow); what is the relationship between user namespaces and other namespace types (PID, UTS, network, etc.); and what are the security implications of user namespaces? We'll also explore some simple shell commands that can be used for creating and experimenting with user namespaces in order to better understand how they work. Along the way, there will hopefully be time for a few live demos.

                Programming & composition share countless traits, including being puzzle-based methods of self-expression as well as the contradictions of being artistic yet technical, collaborative yet individualistic and both can never be "perfected".

                It should therefore not be too surprising that that the old world of classical music has many things in common with the free software movement of today: not only did composers of the past freely remix the works of others every subsequent performance and recording day could be considered a "derived work"...
            </div><div class="abstract">
                But what can we learn today from the wild world of pre-copyright classical music? What mistakes did they make? What did classical music — as performed & composed in the past — appear to get right that we could emulate?
            </div><div class="abstract">
                In this provocative and non-technical talk you will not only learn about how the lack of copyright enforcement or efficient distribution of music affected what was commissioned, composed & performed, you will also discover possible parallels to modern concepts of patents and trademarks.
            </div><div class="abstract">
                In addition, we will explore how the classical world was subject to many social factors we would easily recognise today including Imposter Syndrome, issues around diversity, the role of money, patronage, hoarding and standardisation… as well as ever-present psychological factors of fame, dogma and how limitations continue to shape our world.

Patternfly is an open-source design system that helps our designers and engineers build user friendly products. As the frontend technologies are constantly evolving, this design system has to evolve with them. We would like to talk about the history and evolution of PatternFly - how it was created and how it tries to handle the continuous evolution of the frontend landscape.

                You maintain an Open Source project with great code? Yet your project isn’t succeeding in the ways you want? Maybe you’re struggling with funding or documentation? Or you just can’t find new contributors and you’re drowning in issues and pull requests? Open Source is made up of many components and we are often better-trained in methods for writing good code, than in methods for succeeding in the other dimensions we want our project to grow. In this talk we’ll explore the different components of an Open Source project and how they work together. After this talk you’ll be well-equipped with a ideas and strategies for growing, cultivating, and nourishing your Open Source project.

                <ul><li>Build real relationships with your sponsors and determine ways how both sides can benefit from this relationship, don’t just ask people for money.</li><li>Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard.</li><li>Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes.</li><li>Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner.</li><li>Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your project’s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.</li><li>Implement a Code of Conduct and enforce it if needed: Make your project a safe space to contribute for everyone.</li></ul>

                The aim of this project is to continuously test one of the biggest open source projects on hardware and in qemu. The project started to continuously run functional tests on TS kernels. Tests that gets run are kselftest, ltp, and libhugetlbfs. Running tests on actual hardware isn’t as easy as you may think. Failing tests, hanging tests or flaky tests are some of the issues. The project that was going to run tests on real hardware is called Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT). LKFT uses infrastructure software like Jenkins, LAVA, SQUAD and bugzilla for building, testing, displaying and tracking regressions of the LTS, mainline and next kernels.

                LKFT was created in early summer 2017, and the project has helped to enable LTS kernels being supported for 6 years. KernelCI is also used to build and boot testing, and today kernelCI also implements functional tests.

                We all want our devices to boot faster, but how much effort do you want to dedicate to optimizing and maintaining a custom kernel and apps? This presentation offers a graded list of things you can do to reduce boot time. They start with simple changes, such as adjusting the position of your main application the init sequence. Then there are the changes you can make to the kernel and bootloader configuration to speed things up, and finally, there are moderately advanced techniques such as using U-Boot in falcon mode.

                All of this is done using standard configuration techniques, with the idea of being able to maintain these changes in the future.

                By using tools where you have a clear separation between code branches that makes effects and the ones that doesn't, as for example Haskell, it's very easy to argue that this can be done in a fairly easy manner. But it's not always the case that if a specific code branch is allowed to have side-effects, these should be all possible side-effects. In this short talk, we will be showcasing how you will be able to further restrict effects, granularly and even recursively, in order to limit these side-effects. An example could be an application that only needs to access data from a specific website, limited to a relative URL, and then print it to the console. These effects restrictions will be designed into the application, which will allow you to outsource development to anyone with the right skill-set, even if they have bad intentions, knowing that they will live up to 100% the design or the application will not build.

                FreeBSD is an advanced open source Unix-like operating system with roots in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix originally distributed by the University of California, Berkeley.  It is one of the oldest and largest open source projects in the world, having recently celebrated it's 25th birthday. FreeBSD is used to power modern servers, desktops and embedded system and its advanced networking, storage and security features makes it the platform of choice for many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive networking and storage devices.  When sending a network packet across the Internet, there is a good chance it will touch a FreeBSD system along the way.
