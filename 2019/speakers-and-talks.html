                Long gone are the days of massive books with never-ending stories about your software. Today's users are smarter and less patient, which means that we no longer need to document *all the things*, as long as what we do document is clear, concise, helpful, and accessible. And that's where the real work starts.
            </div><div class="abstract">
                Documentation requires some attitude adjustment, since prose doesn't neatly compile into binaries as code does. But Don't Panic(tm)! No matter what your role is, you can apply a few key principles from the technical writing world to make your project more docs-friendly, and therefore more user- and contributor-friendly.

                The standards community develops specifications. The FOSS community implements standards. The FOSS community also develops industry standards. How does this the interaction function? And is it working well? How do policy makers interact with the FOSS community to set safety standards and other requirements? What is the relationship between standards-essential patents and FOSS? What comes first, specification or implementation? Where does innovation happen, and what is the platform to develop consensus on technical standards in a market segment? Based on research work at TU Berlin and for the Joint Research Center of the European Commission and the work of the Open Invention Network to protect key FOSS projects from patent litigation, the presentation will discuss the current state of the debate at the European and international level, and provide an outlook on how the roles and functions of standards-development organisations and the wider FOSS community are converging. No live demos, unfortunately.

                The future of computing is tiny. Most computers are not desktop, laptops, tablets or mobile phones, but microcontrollers. Small, integrated systems with a few KB of RAM. And their presence is ever growing. Last year alone 31 billion (!) of them were shipped, up from 23 billion in 2015. And they get more capable every day. A modern embedded system has threads, can run Python or JavaScript, and use machine learning models. Why are you not developing for them yet?
            </div><div class="abstract">
                In this talk you'll learn that microcontrollers are not scary, that there's no magic involved, and that working in very constrained systems is actually very fun! You'll also learn a thing or two about getting things to run for years on a battery, try that with a web app. In this talk we'll use Mbed OS, the largest open source Real-Time Operating System for microcontrollers. In 2018 over 17,000 commits were landed in the project, it has over 400 unique contributors, and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

                User namespaces are at the heart of many interesting technologies that allow isolation and sandboxing of applications, for example running containers without root privileges and sandboxes for web browser plug-ins. In this tutorial, we'll look in detail at user namespaces, building up a basic understanding of what a user namespace is and going on to questions such as: what does being &ldquo;superuser inside a user namespace&rdquo; allow you do (and what does it not allow); what is the relationship between user namespaces and other namespace types (PID, UTS, network, etc.); and what are the security implications of user namespaces? We'll also explore some simple shell commands that can be used for creating and experimenting with user namespaces in order to better understand how they work. Along the way, there will hopefully be time for a few live demos.

                Programming & composition share countless traits, including being puzzle-based methods of self-expression as well as the contradictions of being artistic yet technical, collaborative yet individualistic and both can never be "perfected".
            </div><div class="abstract">
                It should therefore not be too surprising that that the old world of classical music has many things in common with the free software movement of today: not only did composers of the past freely remix the works of others every subsequent performance and recording day could be considered a "derived work"...
            </div><div class="abstract">
                But what can we learn today from the wild world of pre-copyright classical music? What mistakes did they make? What did classical music — as performed & composed in the past — appear to get right that we could emulate?
            </div><div class="abstract">
                In this provocative and non-technical talk you will not only learn about how the lack of copyright enforcement or efficient distribution of music affected what was commissioned, composed & performed, you will also discover possible parallels to modern concepts of patents and trademarks.
            </div><div class="abstract">
                In addition, we will explore how the classical world was subject to many social factors we would easily recognise today including Imposter Syndrome, issues around diversity, the role of money, patronage, hoarding and standardisation… as well as ever-present psychological factors of fame, dogma and how limitations continue to shape our world.

                You maintain an Open Source project with great code? Yet your project isn’t succeeding in the ways you want? Maybe you’re struggling with funding or documentation? Or you just can’t find new contributors and you’re drowning in issues and pull requests? Open Source is made up of many components and we are often better-trained in methods for writing good code, than in methods for succeeding in the other dimensions we want our project to grow. In this talk we’ll explore the different components of an Open Source project and how they work together.

                <ul><li>Build real relationships with your sponsors and determine ways how both sides can benefit from this relationship, don’t just ask people for money.</li><li>Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard.</li><li>Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes.</li><li>Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner.</li><li>Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your project’s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.</li><li>Implement a Code of Conduct and enforce it if needed: Make your project a safe space to contribute for everyone.</li></ul>

                The aim of this project is to continuously test one of the biggest open source projects on hardware and in qemu. The project started to continuously run functional tests on TS kernels. Tests that gets run are kselftest, ltp, and libhugetlbfs. Running tests on actual hardware isn’t as easy as you may think. Failing tests, hanging tests or flaky tests are some of the issues. The project that was going to run tests on real hardware is called Linux Kernel Functional Testing (LKFT). LKFT uses infrastructure software like Jenkins, LAVA, SQUAD and bugzilla for building, testing, displaying and tracking regressions of the LTS, mainline and next kernels.
            </div><div class="abstract">
                LKFT was created in early summer 2017, and the project has helped to enable LTS kernels being supported for 6 years. KernelCI is also used to build and boot testing, and today kernelCI also implements functional tests.
