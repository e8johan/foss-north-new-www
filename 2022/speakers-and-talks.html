                IEEE is a NonProfit with over 420K members in 180 Countries. We wanted to create a platform that would be in existence not for the next 3-5 years but instead for the next couple of decades to support our standards making process. We have a very diverse community. One of the first things we decided to focus on is Role Diversity. In this presentation, we will talk about how volunteers are creating groups and processes in a transparent fashion. Being 100% Open Source is a key philosophy that drives this community forward. I will review our entire community architecture and its evolution in the past year. We believe that diversity is key to both sustainability and quality. I will cover all the work done globally by our volunteers to support this.

                JavaScript has had a long history of general security risks associated with it and React — the most popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components — is no exception.

                Oniro is a Free and Open Source Software, multi-platform, multi-kernel, low spec and embedded interoperable operating system based on Yocto Bitbake. In this context, from the same code base, many different images can be built, with a build matrix counting more than 40 different target images, all containing different sets of software components: which in concrete means millions of source files and -- licensing wise -- a nightmare. Bitbake is incredilby flexible, but not quite transparent as to what software is summoned in. Taming this complexity has required a new approach and developing new tools and procedures, also incorporating CVE scanning and security elements, a dedicated dashboard and Aliens4friends, our solution to find licensing information to package matching. Our presentation is a show-and-tell of how we produced a SBOM for as many as 2,000,000 files and almost 300 different licenses with a team of 3.5, also discussing the challenges and some odd discovery about popular packages.

            <div class="abstract">
                Qemu is a powerful tool and in my view one part of the hardware renaissance around RISCV. But like most it comes with trade-offs. Due to the power of the first freedom we are able to learn these tradeoffs from the source, literally. This talk is an active exercise of this freedom, highlighting the inner working of qemu by leveraging the open source, mailing list and related documentation.

                Driven by a desire to understand the insides of software Florian has always been drawn to the underlying technologies. Most recently this has led to thinking about how knowledge about these technologies is gained and communicated.
